# JavaScript File System
This is a small and handy file system that anyone can use, just make sure that the files are linked together by having a `<script src="filesystem.js"></script>` inside of the HTML file you want to work with. 

**Note: `the saveFile()` function inside of `filesystem.js` saves the files changes. The `saveAsFile()` function allows the user to save the file to a different location with a different name.

## Other important information
This file system follows the one-video tutorial made by CodePulse, you can find him [here](https://www.youtube.com/c/CodePulse). This file system is configurable and you can fork this project in order to add on to it, although I don't know why you would do that because this is as simple as it gets.
